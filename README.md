# random-forest-classifier-for-stock-return-prediction

This project is the application of a random forest classifier (RFC) to forecast US S&P 500 companies' relative returns. We apply RFC to predict whether a stock will give a 2 % return in the next 10 trading days and also implemented our proposed Naïve classifier, Naïve contrarian classifier, and Random choice classifier to rationally compare the performance of RFC.
